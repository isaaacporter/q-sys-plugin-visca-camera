# VISCA Camera
QSC Q-SYS plugin for RS232/IP control of VISCA cameras using the standard VISCA or VISCA over IP protocols. This plugin allows you to mix and match Connection types and protocols. While the RS232 connection with the VISCA over IP command set is not helpful, some cameras, like PTZ Optics cameras, use the standard VISCA command set over IP instead of the VISCA over IP command set.
